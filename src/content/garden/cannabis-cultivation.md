Teaching cannabis cultivation at Northeastern Institute of Cannabis taught me that growing plants and growing systems share deep structural similarities.

## The Plant as System

A cannabis plant is a complex adaptive system responding to:

- **Light** — Photoperiod triggers flowering, spectrum affects morphology
- **Water** — Both quantity and timing matter
- **Nutrients** — N-P-K ratios shift through lifecycle
- **Environment** — Temperature, humidity, CO2 levels
- **Stress** — Controlled stress can enhance or destroy

Each of these is a variable, but they don't operate independently. They form feedback loops.

## Feedback Loops in Cultivation

**Reinforcing loop example:** More nitrogen → more vegetative growth → more leaf surface → more photosynthesis → more nutrient demand → need more nitrogen

**Balancing loop example:** High temperature → stomata close → reduced transpiration → leaf temperature rises → plant stress signals → grower reduces temperature

Understanding these loops is the difference between following recipes and actually growing.

## What I'm Developing

- A systems-thinking approach to cultivation curriculum
- Connecting [[leverage-points-systems|leverage point theory]] to practical growing decisions
- Documentation of failure patterns (where most learning happens)

## Still Learning

This note is a seedling because my understanding is still developing. The teaching experience gave me foundational knowledge, but deep expertise takes years of practice.
