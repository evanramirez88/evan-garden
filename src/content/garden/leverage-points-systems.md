Donella Meadows identified twelve leverage points where interventions can be made in complex systems, ordered from least to most effective:

## The Hierarchy

12. **Constants, parameters, numbers** — The least effective. Adjusting a thermostat setting.
11. **Buffer sizes** — Stabilizing stocks relative to flows.
10. **Stock-and-flow structure** — Physical systems and their constraints.
9. **Delays** — The timing of feedback loops.
8. **Balancing feedback loops** — The strength of negative feedbacks.
7. **Reinforcing feedback loops** — The gain of positive feedbacks.
6. **Information flows** — Who has access to what information.
5. **Rules** — Incentives, punishments, constraints.
4. **Self-organization** — The ability to change system structure.
3. **Goals** — The purpose of the system.
2. **Paradigms** — The mindset out of which the system arises.
1. **Transcending paradigms** — Seeing all paradigms as limited.

## Why This Matters

Most people focus on parameters (level 12) because they're visible and measurable. A restaurant manager might obsess over labor percentage. But the high-leverage interventions happen at the goal and paradigm levels.

[[leverage-points-restaurant|In restaurant operations]], the real leverage isn't in scheduling efficiency—it's in redefining what the operation is trying to accomplish.

## The Paradox

The higher-leverage the intervention, the more the system resists change. Paradigms are incredibly hard to shift. But when they do shift, everything downstream reorganizes naturally.

This is why [[systems-thinking-intro|systems thinking]] matters: it helps you see where you're actually applying force.
