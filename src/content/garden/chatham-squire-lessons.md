The Chatham Squire is a 500-seat restaurant and raw bar on Cape Cod. I managed it for six years. Here's what that taught me.

## The Scale Challenge

500 seats isn't a restaurant—it's a logistics operation that happens to serve food. On a summer Saturday:
- 2,000+ covers
- 80+ staff
- Thousands of individual decisions
- Countless potential failure points

You can't manage this through direct supervision. You need systems.

## Lesson 1: Systems Beat Heroics

Early on, I thought management meant solving problems. Bad ticket? I'd fix it. Conflict? I'd mediate. Shortage? I'd scramble.

This doesn't scale. When you're the solution to every problem, you become the bottleneck.

The shift: build systems that solve problems without you. Train people who can handle exceptions. Create processes that self-correct.

## Lesson 2: The Kitchen Is a Complex Adaptive System

Apply [[systems-thinking-intro|systems thinking]] to a kitchen and you see:
- **Stocks**: Prepped ingredients, clean plates, available staff
- **Flows**: Orders in, plates out, dishes to wash
- **Feedback loops**: Ticket times inform expo pace
- **Delays**: Prep done today affects service tomorrow

Understanding this changes how you intervene. You stop fighting symptoms and start adjusting structure.

## Lesson 3: Technology Is a Multiplier

Implementing [[toast-pos-mastery|Toast POS]] transformed our operations. But technology alone isn't the answer—it multiplies whatever you already have.

- Good systems + good technology = exponential improvement
- Bad systems + good technology = faster chaos

We spent months preparing our processes before the rollout. The technology then amplified those prepared systems.

## Lesson 4: Staff Are Not Resources

The language of "human resources" treats people as interchangeable inputs. They're not.

Each person brings:
- Unique capabilities
- Different motivations
- Varying growth trajectories
- Distinct ways of contributing

The best managers match people to roles, not roles to people. This takes time to understand each individual.

## Lesson 5: Hospitality Is Emotional Labor

Guests don't just want food and service. They want to *feel* a certain way. Staff must project warmth, patience, and presence—regardless of how they actually feel.

This is exhausting. Burnout is endemic. The manager's job is to create conditions where emotional labor is sustainable:
- Adequate breaks
- Supportive culture
- Permission to be human (backstage)
- Recognition for the invisible work

## Lesson 6: Crisis Reveals Truth

Equipment fails. Staff quit. Deliveries don't arrive. Weather changes. Pandemics happen.

Crisis strips away pretense. What remains is:
- Your actual systems (not your documented ones)
- Your real culture (not your stated values)
- Your true leadership (not your good days)

Every crisis is data about who you actually are.

## What I Carry Forward

These lessons apply far beyond restaurants:
- Build systems that scale without you
- Understand feedback loops and delays
- Technology multiplies, doesn't transform
- People are individuals, not resources
- Emotional labor needs support
- Crisis reveals truth

The Squire was my systems thinking laboratory. Everything I do now builds on what I learned there.
