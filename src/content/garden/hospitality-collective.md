Traditional restaurant groups operate as holding companies—centralized ownership with distributed operations. What if we inverted this?

## The Current Model's Problems

Typical restaurant groups:
- Concentrate equity at the top
- Limit operator upside
- Create misaligned incentives
- Burn out talented people
- Struggle with succession

The people doing the hardest work rarely share meaningfully in the value they create.

## The Collective Vision

Imagine a restaurant organization structured as:
- **Shared infrastructure**: Back office, purchasing, legal, marketing
- **Distributed ownership**: Each venue has operator-owners
- **Aligned incentives**: Success benefits everyone
- **Knowledge transfer**: Lessons flow between venues
- **Succession path**: Operators can grow into ownership

## How It Would Work

### Ownership Structure
- Central entity owns shared infrastructure
- Each restaurant is a separate entity
- Operating partners hold meaningful equity in their venue
- Central entity holds minority stake in each restaurant
- Clear buyout paths for operator equity growth

### Shared Resources
- Collective purchasing power
- Shared accounting and payroll
- Group health insurance
- Marketing and brand development
- Technology and systems
- Legal and compliance

### Knowledge Flow
- Regular operator gatherings
- Shared playbooks and systems
- Cross-venue mentorship
- Collective learning from failures

## The Systems Perspective

This creates different [[systems-thinking-intro|feedback loops]] than traditional structures:

**Traditional Group**
- Operator succeeds → company benefits → operator gets salary
- Limited reinforcing loop for operators

**Collective Model**
- Operator succeeds → operator benefits directly → more effort → more success
- Strong reinforcing loop aligned with performance

## Challenges

This isn't simple to execute:
- **Legal complexity**: Multiple entities, varying structures
- **Governance**: Balancing autonomy with collective benefit
- **Culture**: Requires high-trust, low-ego operators
- **Capital**: Different investor expectations

## Why I'm Thinking About This

The hospitality industry burns people out. The best operators often leave to start their own things because that's the only path to real ownership.

What if we could create a structure where:
- Great operators build equity while operating
- They benefit from scale without losing autonomy
- The collective is greater than the sum of parts
- Succession happens naturally

This is a seedling idea—very early stage. I'm collecting examples, talking to operators, and exploring what structures might work.
