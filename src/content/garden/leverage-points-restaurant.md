Most restaurant consulting focuses on the wrong things. Labor percentage, food cost, ticket times—these are all **parameters** (leverage point 12, the weakest).

## Where Real Leverage Lives

### Information Flows (Level 6)
Who knows what, and when? A line cook who can see ticket patterns in real-time makes better prep decisions than one who gets a printout at the end of the day.

Toast POS becomes a leverage tool not because of its features, but because of how it surfaces information to decision-makers.

### Rules (Level 5)
The unwritten rules of a restaurant determine everything. "We don't 86 items until they're actually gone" vs "We 86 when we hit 3 portions" fundamentally changes behavior.

### Goals (Level 3)
A restaurant optimizing for covers behaves differently than one optimizing for guest experience. Both can be profitable—but the systems that emerge are radically different.

## The Chatham Squire Lessons

Six years taught me that the difference between good shifts and bad shifts rarely came down to staffing levels. It came down to:

- Whether the right information reached the right people
- Whether the implicit rules were aligned with the explicit goals
- Whether the team understood *why* certain patterns worked

[[leverage-points-systems|Meadows' framework]] gives language to what experienced operators feel intuitively.

## Questions I'm Still Exploring

- How do you shift paradigms in a restaurant with 30+ years of history?
- Where does [[hospitality-collective|the collective concept]] fit in this framework?
