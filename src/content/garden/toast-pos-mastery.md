Toast POS isn't just a cash register—it's the nervous system of modern restaurant operations. After years of implementation, training, and optimization, I've developed deep expertise in making Toast work as a true operational lever.

## Beyond Basic Configuration

Most Toast implementations scratch the surface. The real power comes from:

### Menu Engineering
- Modifier logic that speeds service rather than slowing it
- Course firing configuration that matches kitchen capacity
- Smart categorization for reporting and analysis

### Labor Integration
- Schedule templates that account for actual demand patterns
- Tip pooling configurations that align incentives
- Time clock rules that minimize payroll overhead

### Reporting & Analytics
- Custom report configurations for decision-making
- Sales mix analysis for menu optimization
- Labor cost tracking at the granular level

## The System View

Toast becomes a [[leverage-points-restaurant|leverage point]] when you understand it as part of a larger system:

- It surfaces **information flows** to the right people at the right time
- It encodes **rules** about how the restaurant operates
- It creates **feedback loops** between front and back of house

The difference between a Toast installation that helps and one that hinders often comes down to whether it was configured with systems thinking.

## Common Mistakes

- Over-complicated modifier trees that slow ordering
- Report configurations that generate noise, not signal
- Kitchen display settings that create bottlenecks
- Integration gaps between Toast and other systems

## What I Can Help With

- New implementation planning and configuration
- Optimization of existing Toast setups
- Staff training on efficient Toast usage
- Integration with other restaurant systems
