Most restaurant operators see daily chaos. Systems thinkers see patterns. Here's how to develop that lens.

## The Basic Framework

Every restaurant is a system of:
- **Stocks**: Things that accumulate (inventory, cash, staff skills, reputation)
- **Flows**: Things that move (orders, plates, revenue, turnover)
- **Feedback loops**: Effects that circle back (reviews → traffic → revenue → investment → quality → reviews)

## Mapping the Kitchen

### Stocks
- Prepped ingredients in walk-in
- Clean dishes available
- Staff energy/focus
- Outstanding tickets

### Flows
- Orders entering
- Plates leaving
- Dishes cycling through wash
- Staff entering/leaving shift

### Key Feedback Loops
- **Ticket backup loop**: More tickets → longer times → guest complaints → manager intervention → expediting → resolved (balancing)
- **Prep momentum loop**: Good prep → smooth service → less stress → staff retention → experienced prep team → better prep (reinforcing)

## Mapping the Floor

### Stocks
- Available tables
- Guest satisfaction levels
- Server energy/morale
- Open checks

### Flows
- Guests arriving/departing
- Orders to kitchen
- Food to tables
- Payments closing

### Key Feedback Loops
- **Table turn loop**: Fast turns → more revenue → better staffing → faster turns (reinforcing until capacity limit)
- **Service quality loop**: Good service → tips → motivated servers → good service (reinforcing)
- **Overwhelm loop**: Too busy → mistakes → complaints → manager time → less supervision → more mistakes (reinforcing, dangerous)

## The Power of This Lens

When you see systems:

**Instead of**: "The kitchen is slow tonight"
**You see**: The ticket stock is building faster than plates flow out. Where's the constraint?

**Instead of**: "Servers are unmotivated"
**You see**: The reinforcing loop between effort and reward is broken. What's blocking it?

**Instead of**: "We're always short-staffed"
**You see**: The turnover flow exceeds the hiring flow. What's driving turnover?

## Delays Are Critical

Restaurant systems have significant delays:
- Training investment → performance improvement: 2-6 months
- Reputation building → traffic increase: 3-12 months
- Culture change → behavior change: 6-18 months
- Menu change → guest perception: 1-3 months

Ignoring delays leads to:
- Giving up on changes before they take effect
- Overcorrecting when you don't see immediate results
- Mistaking correlation for causation

## Practical Application

Next time you're in a restaurant:
1. Identify three stocks you can observe
2. Watch the flows between them
3. Look for feedback loops
4. Notice delays between cause and effect

This practice develops the [[systems-thinking-intro|systems thinking]] muscle that transfers to any domain.
