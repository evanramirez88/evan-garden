CAMELOT is my framework for orchestrating multiple AI agents into coherent systems.

## Core Concepts

- **Context Awareness**: Agents understand their position in the larger system
- **Multi-Expert Architecture**: Specialized agents for different cognitive tasks
- **Layered Orchestration**: Task, Context, Strategy, and Goal layers
- **Technology Agnosticism**: Works with any AI provider

## Status

Active development. Core patterns are stable; specific tooling continues to evolve.
