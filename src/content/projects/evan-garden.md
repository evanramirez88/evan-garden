evan.garden is both the medium and a message — a digital garden that embodies the systems thinking principles it discusses.

## Technical Foundation

- **Astro 5**: Static site generation with islands architecture
- **Svelte 5**: Interactive components with runes
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling with custom design tokens
- **Cloudflare Pages**: Edge deployment with zero cold starts

## Key Features

- **Sliding Panes**: Andy Matuschak-style stacked notes for context preservation
- **Wikilinks**: `[[note-slug]]` syntax for organic cross-referencing
- **Knowledge Graph**: D3.js visualization of note connections
- **Generative Visuals**: Canvas-based procedural topic identities
- **Pagefind Search**: Static search with instant results

## Design Philosophy

The visual language draws from three influences:

1. **Maggie Appleton**: Digital garden information architecture
2. **Bruno Simon**: Experimental, generative web presence
3. **Rapha/Aesop**: Premium restraint and warm minimalism

## Status

Active development. The garden grows with new notes and refinements to the underlying systems.
