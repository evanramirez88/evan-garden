System-of-One applies CAMELOT orchestration principles to personal productivity.

## The Idea

A solopreneur or small team can operate with the capabilities of a much larger organization by properly orchestrating AI agents for different functions:

- Research and analysis
- Content creation and editing
- Task management and scheduling
- Communication and outreach

## Status

Conceptual phase. Documenting patterns and building initial implementations.
