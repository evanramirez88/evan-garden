          I believe that breadth of knowledge becomes a superpower when unified through
          systems thinking. Everything connects when you look at how it works, not just what it is.

      <!-- Bio -->
      <div class="space-y-6 text-text-secondary mb-16">
        <p>
          I'm <strong class="text-text-primary">Evan Ramirez</strong>—a generalist who has chosen
          depth through diversity rather than narrow specialization. My work spans restaurant
          technology, horticulture education, AI systems development, and beyond.
        </p>

        <p>
          The common thread is <strong class="text-text-primary">systems thinking</strong>. Whether
          I'm optimizing restaurant operations, teaching cannabis cultivation, or building AI agent
          orchestration frameworks, I'm always looking at the same thing: how components interact,
          where feedback loops exist, and where small interventions create outsized effects.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong class="text-text-primary">Donella Meadows</strong> is my intellectual north star.
          Her work on leverage points and systems behavior provides the framework I apply to everything.
          A restaurant is a system. A plant is a system. An AI agent workflow is a system. The
          principles transfer.

              Six years at The Chatham Squire gave me deep operational knowledge of how hospitality
              actually works. Not theory—reality. Toast POS mastery, service flow optimization,
              team coordination under pressure. This foundation informs a hospitality collective
              concept I'm developing.

            <p class="text-text-secondary">
              Teaching at Northeastern Institute of Cannabis revealed that cultivation is applied
              systems thinking. Plants respond to feedback loops. Environment, nutrients, stress—all
              variables in a complex adaptive system. Teaching forced me to articulate what intuitive
              growers feel but can't always explain.

              The CAMELOT framework (Context-Aware Multi-Expert Layered Orchestration Technology)
              is my approach to building coherent AI systems. Multiple specialized agents, coordinated
              through clear context and layered control. The System-of-One concept extends this to
              personal productivity—a single person augmented by well-orchestrated AI.

              NFL analysis, games, whatever captures my attention. Play is where ideas get tested
              without stakes. The analytical frameworks I develop for "fun" often transfer to
              serious applications.

          Why a Digital Garden?
        </h2>
        <div class="space-y-4 text-text-secondary">
          <p>
            Traditional portfolios present finished work. But I'm interested in
            <strong class="text-text-primary">ideas in progress</strong>—the seedlings that might
            become something, the budding thoughts that are still developing, the evergreen
            principles that have proven their value over time.
          </p>
          <p>
            A digital garden lets me publish thinking at various stages without the pressure
            of false completeness. It's honest about the fact that knowledge grows, changes,
            and sometimes gets pruned.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <strong class="text-text-primary">bidirectional links</strong> matter too.
            Ideas don't exist in isolation—they connect, reference each other, form networks.
            This garden makes those connections visible through backlinks and the knowledge graph.
